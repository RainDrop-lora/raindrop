# V1.0 board is analysed

Both MCU and RFM95 are in sleep.

VCC - 6V

Overall current consumption stays at 305uA

* RFM95 VCC pin draws 0.5uA 
* RFM95 GND current is 0.5uA

RFM95 removed from board, RS485 transceiver removed
Board cleaned

pin level is set to default sleep value before setting it as input -- this seems to have impact

Overall current consumption is 9uA

RS485 transceiver put back

Overall current consumption is 12uA

Code changed to enable RS485 transceiver at the startup

RFM95 soldered back with resistors:
 * DIO01 - 10k
 * IRQ - 10k
 * MISO - 10k
 * MOSI - 330
 * SCK - 330
 * NSS - 330
 * RST - 10k

RFM95 is not initialized in FW

Overall current consumption is 2mA

RFM95 initialization put back to FW

Overall current consumption is 10mA, MCU does not finish initializing RFM95

MISO resistor replaced to 220

Initialization passes. Current consumption is about 38uA
Touching MISO line at RFM95 size reduces current consumption down to 12uA
Rising the board from antistatic pad also reduces current consumption down to 10-12uA. 
Holding hand over board increases current consumption.

MISO resistor replaced with a link

Overall current consumption is 10uA
Board is on longer susceptable to hand movement or placement on antistatic pad

RST resistor replaced with a link

NO change - Overall current consumption is 10uA

DIO01 resistor replaced with a link

NO change - Overall current consumption is 10uA

IRQ resistor replaced with a link

NO change - Overall current consumption is 10uA

MOSI resistor replaced with a link

NO change - Overall current consumption is 10uA

SCK resistor replaced with a link

NO change - Overall current consumption is 10uA

NSS resistor replaced with a link

NO change - Overall current consumption is 10uA

* Conclusions: V1.0 board stays in 10uA sleep current with RFM95 connected with no resistors

# V1.1 board is analysed

VCC = 6V
all RFM95 pins are connected via 1k resistor

Overall sleep current is 60uA

Board cleaned with Isopropyl alcohol

Overall sleep current increased to over 100uA, a lot of 50Hz noise visible on current signal

Board cleaned with Isopropyl alcohol even more, MISO resistor replaced with 0 Ohm link

Overall sleep current dropped to 65uA

MOSI and SCK resistors replaced with 0 Ohm - no improvement

RFM95 removed - on improvement, current stays at ~74uA

R24 desoldered - current dropped to 9uA; D3 is a leaky Schottky!!!

D3 replaced with 1n4148 - current is 15uA which is nominal.

RFM95 soldered back

Overall sleep current is 15uA!!!

ALL resistors removed from RFM95 lines, sleep current is still 15uA

#FW changes

pins left as outputs with default sleep high/low states

Overall sleep current is 15uA

Add a 1M pulldown to MISO line - a slight improvement in current consumption - down to 14.5uA, no sensitivity to touching anymore.

# Active mode current consumption

* SF7 -  38mC per message
* SF8 -  43mC
* SF9 -  58mC
* SF10 - 68mC
* SF11 - 119mC
* SF12 - 182mC
